# Basic Server - Java Spring Boot

This is a simple RESTful server running on Java Spring Boot. This project is meant to compliment the [MLApp Demo](https://google.com),
providing user login and verification and storing GSP and photo data from the MLApp Demo to a mongodb database.

This project provides both maven and gradle build and run scripts so you can build and run the server as you prefer. I am a fan
of docker however which is my usual deploy method, so Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml have been included as well.
